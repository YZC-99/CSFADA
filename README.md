# Continual Source-Free Active Domain Adaptation for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Tumor Segmentation across Multiple Hospitals

This repository contains the official implementation of our paper. 

# Dataset ðŸ“Š
We use the multi-center NPC T1-weighted MRI dataset released by [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10553522). This dataset is the first publicly available multi-center GTV segmentation dataset for research purposes, focusing on patients diagnosed with NPC. The dataset contains annotated GTV data obtained from three different medical institutions (CenterA, CenterB, and CenterC). 
The dataset includes 50, 50, and 60 patients from CenterA, CenterB, and CenterC, respectively, each associated with a single T1-weighted MRI image. 
In our experiments, for each center, the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets at a ratio of 7:1:2.
